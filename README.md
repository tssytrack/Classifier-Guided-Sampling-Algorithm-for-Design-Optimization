# Classifier-Guided_Sampling_Algorithm_for_Design_Optimization

The goal of this project is to implement Classifier-Guided Sampling (CGS) method in solving engineering optimization problems (Backlund, Shahan, and Seepersad, 2014). The CGS method uses the knowledge/guidance of machine learning classifiers to sample the potential good designs and to find the optimum design using the least amount of expensive evaluations. In this project, we implemented the CGS method with various Bayesian network classifiers on the two optimization problems.
